  Identification Principle:
  Every element appearing in requirements must have a unique number or key allowing unambiguous identification.

  This is currently accomplished by assigning a reqId property to the `belongs` relationship
  with a uniqueness constraint on (reqId, right) in the database.

  THis should enforce uniqueness of reqId within a solution.
