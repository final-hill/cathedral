## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - `choco install vscode`
- WSL2
  - [WSL2 Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
  - `choco install docker-desktop`
- [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)
  - `choco install pgadmin4`

## Project Setup

1. Update your local machine hosts file to include the following entry:

```
127.0.0.1 cathedral.local
```

2. Start Docker Desktop.
3. Open the project in VS Code.
4. The project should automatically detect the `.devcontainer` folder and ask you to reopen the project in a container. Before doing so, Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the necessary values.
5. Reopen the project in the dev container. (You can also do this by clicking on the blue button in the bottom left corner of the window.)
6. The project will now start downloading the necessary dependencies and setting up the environment.
  1. Docker images
  2. Node modules
  3. VS Code extensions

## Database population

There are a number of commands defined in `package.json` that can be run to populate the database with data:

1. `npm run orm-create-db`
2. `npm run orm-run-pending-migrations`
3. `npm run orm-seed-users`

## Running the project

The project can be run in debug mode via: `npm run dev`. You can then access the application at `https://cathedral.local`.

A production build can be run via: `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview`. You can then access the application at `https://cathedral.local`.

## Data model

The database is in Version Normal Form to support temporal data. More details available [here](https://github.com/final-hill/cathedral/issues/435).

## Application Architecture

The application is a [monolith](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html) following a layered architecture. The application is split into the following layers:

### Server

- domain
   - Entities & Value Objects
- data
   - models (used by MikroORM)
- api
   - This is currently blending the application and infrastructure layers. This will be refactored in the future by separating the application and infrastructure layers.

### Client

- pages
- components
- layouts

## CI/CD Notes

The Infrastructure is managed by Azure Bicep. The CI/CD pipeline is managed by GitHub Actions.
Communication between GitHub and Azure is managed by OpenID Connect.

  - [Supporting details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-cli%2Cwindows#use-the-azure-login-action-with-openid-connect)
- [GitHub Environment details](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/administering-github-actions/managing-environments-for-deployment)

## Slackbot testing

Create an ngrok tunnel to the local server:

```bash
ngrok http https://localhost:3000
```

Update the Slackbot configuration (Event Subscriptions) to point to the generated ngrok tunnel.

`https://<ngrok-url>/api/slack`

Note that this will only work if the server is running locally (`npm run dev`).

Once the local server is stopped, the ngrok tunnel will be closed and the Slackbot will no longer work.

Also update the `.env` file with the ngrok URL:

```env
NUXT_SLACK_OAUTH_ORIGIN=https://73cfd69848d9.ngrok-free.app
```

After updating the `.env` file, rebuild the devcontainer to apply the changes.

## Requirements Workflow

The Cathedral application implements a comprehensive workflow system for managing requirements throughout their lifecycle. This workflow ensures quality control, proper review processes, and maintains traceability of all requirement changes.

### Workflow States

Requirements in Cathedral follow a five-state workflow:

#### 1. **Proposed**
- **Purpose**: Initial state for newly created requirements
- **Description**: Requirements that have been submitted but not yet reviewed or approved
- **Actions Available**:
  - **Edit**: Modify the requirement content while maintaining the Proposed state
  - **Submit for Review**: Move the requirement to the Review state
  - **Remove**: Move the requirement to the Removed state

#### 2. **Review** (also called "In Review")
- **Purpose**: Requirements undergoing evaluation for approval
- **Description**: Requirements that are being assessed for correctness, completeness, and alignment with project goals
- **Actions Available**:
  - **Review**: Open the review dialog to approve or reject the requirement
  - **Approve**: Move the requirement to the Active state and generate a unique `ReqId`
  - **Reject**: Move the requirement to the Rejected state

**Approval Validation**: Before a requirement can be approved and moved to Active state, all referenced requirements (such as Primary Actor, Outcome, etc.) must already be in the Active state. This ensures topological ordering and prevents broken references. If any referenced requirement is not Active, the approval will fail with a clear error message indicating which requirement needs to be approved first.

**Dropdown Behavior**: While editing requirements in Review state, dropdown menus will show requirements from all visible workflow states (Active, Proposed, Review) to allow flexibility during editing. However, the approval validation ensures data integrity at the time of activation.

#### 3. **Active**
- **Purpose**: Requirements that are officially part of the project
- **Description**: Requirements that have been approved and are currently in effect. Each Active requirement has a unique ReqId for tracking and reference
- **Actions Available**:
  - **Revise**: Create a new version in the Proposed state (original remains Active until the revision is approved)
    - **Restriction**: Cannot revise if there are newer versions already in Proposed or Review states to prevent conflicting parallel changes
  - **Remove**: Move the requirement to the Removed state

**Versioning Behavior**: When an Active requirement is revised, a new version is created in the Proposed state while the original Active version remains unchanged. This allows for parallel development where multiple proposed changes can exist simultaneously, each following independent review processes. However, to prevent conflicts, only one revision can be in progress at a time.

#### 4. **Rejected**
- **Purpose**: Requirements that were reviewed but not approved
- **Description**: Requirements that failed review and need revision before resubmission
- **Actions Available**:
  - **Revise**: Modify and move back to the Proposed state for another review cycle
  - **Remove**: Move the requirement to the Removed state

#### 5. **Removed**
- **Purpose**: Requirements that have been deleted from active consideration
- **Description**: Requirements that are no longer part of the project but are preserved for audit trails
- **Actions Available**:
  - **Restore**: Return the requirement to the Proposed state

### Special Case: Silence Requirements

**Silence** requirements have unique workflow behavior due to their nature as unparseable content:

- **Automatic State**: Silence requirements are automatically placed in the **Rejected** state when created
- **Limited Transitions**: Can only transition from Rejected â†’ Removed
- **No Restoration**: Once in the Removed state, Silence requirements cannot be moved to any other state
- **Purpose**: These represent content that could not be parsed into proper requirements and serve as placeholders for malformed input

### Special Case: ParsedRequirements

**ParsedRequirements** have unique workflow behavior as they are container requirements for auto-generated content:

- **Automatic State**: ParsedRequirements are automatically placed in the **Parsed** state when created
- **No State Transitions**: ParsedRequirements cannot be moved to any other workflow state
- **Container Role**: They serve as containers for multiple individual requirements that were parsed from natural language
- **Non-Actionable**: ParsedRequirements themselves are not actionable requirements but exist to group related parsed requirements
- **UI Behavior**: The workflow state is not displayed in the UI for ParsedRequirements, and workflow filtering is not available
- **Source Tracking**: The `name` field is used to distinguish the source of parsed requirements:
  - **"Free-form requirements"** - Created via the web UI form
  - **"Slack Requirements"** - Created via Slack bot interactions
  - This naming convention enables auditing, user experience tracking, and system analytics

### Workflow Transitions

The following state transitions are supported:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Proposed : Create Requirement
    [*] --> Rejected : Create Silence
    [*] --> Parsed : Create ParsedRequirements

    Proposed --> Review : Submit for Review
    Proposed --> Removed : Remove

    Review --> Active : Approve
    Review --> Rejected : Reject

    Active --> Proposed : Revise (new version)
    Active --> Removed : Remove

    Rejected --> Proposed : Revise<br>(normal requirements)
    Rejected --> Removed : Remove

    Removed --> Proposed : Restore<br>(normal requirements only)

    note right of Active : Generates unique ReqId
    note right of Proposed : New version created<br>when revising Active
    note right of Rejected : Silence requirements<br>Remove only<br>no restore
    note left of Review : Approval requires all<br>referenced requirements<br>to be Active
```

### Permission Requirements

All workflow operations require specific permission levels:

- **Organization Reader**: Can view requirements in all states
- **Organization Contributor**: Can perform all workflow operations (create, edit, review, approve, reject, remove, restore)
- **Organization Admin**: Has all contributor permissions plus user management capabilities

### Requirement Versioning and Parallel Development

The Cathedral system supports a sophisticated versioning model that allows for parallel development of requirements:

#### Version Creation
- Each requirement can have multiple versions over time
- Versions are identified by their `effectiveFrom` timestamp
- Only one version can be **Active** at any given time
- Multiple versions can exist simultaneously in **Proposed** or **Review** states

#### Parallel Development Support
The system supports multiple concurrent changes to the same requirement:

1. **Active Requirement**: The current official version with a unique `ReqId`
2. **Parallel Proposals**: Multiple independent revisions can be proposed simultaneously
3. **Independent Review**: Each proposed version follows its own review cycle
4. **Conflict Prevention**: Only one revision process can be initiated at a time from the same Active version

#### Example Workflow
Consider requirement R.1.1 that is currently **Active**:

1. User A creates a revision â†’ New version R.1.1-Rev1 in **Proposed** state
2. User B attempts to create another revision â†’ **Blocked** (conflicts with existing revision)
3. R.1.1-Rev1 moves through **Review** â†’ **Active** (becomes R.1.2)
4. Now User B can create a revision from R.1.2

This prevents conflicting changes and ensures clear change management.

### Implementation Details

#### API Endpoints

The workflow is implemented through RESTful API endpoints following the pattern:
- `PUT /api/requirements/[reqType]/propose` - Create new requirement
- `POST /api/requirements/[reqType]/proposed/[id]/edit` - Edit proposed requirement
- `POST /api/requirements/[reqType]/proposed/[id]/review` - Submit for review
- `POST /api/requirements/[reqType]/proposed/[id]/remove` - Remove proposed requirement
- `POST /api/requirements/[reqType]/review/[id]/approve` - Approve requirement
- `POST /api/requirements/[reqType]/review/[id]/reject` - Reject requirement
- `POST /api/requirements/[reqType]/rejected/[id]/revise` - Revise rejected requirement
- `POST /api/requirements/[reqType]/rejected/[id]/remove` - Remove rejected requirement
- `POST /api/requirements/[reqType]/active/[id]/edit` - Revise active requirement (fails if newer versions exist in Proposed or Review states to prevent parallel conflicts)
- `POST /api/requirements/[reqType]/active/[id]/remove` - Remove active requirement
- `POST /api/requirements/[reqType]/removed/[id]/restore` - Restore removed requirement

**Note**: For Silence requirements (`reqType` = "silence"):
- Silence requirements are automatically created in the Rejected state
- Only the remove operation (`POST /api/requirements/silence/rejected/[id]/remove`) is available
- Restore operations are not supported for removed Silence requirements

**Note**: For ParsedRequirements (`reqType` = "parsed_requirements"):
- ParsedRequirements are automatically created in the Parsed state
- No workflow operations are available as they are non-actionable containers
- They serve only as grouping mechanisms for individual parsed requirements

#### UI Components

The workflow is primarily managed through the `XWorkflow.vue` component, which provides:
- Tabular display of requirements with state-based filtering
- Context menus with appropriate actions for each state
- Modal dialogs for editing, reviewing, and confirming operations
- Real-time state updates and notifications

#### Autocomplete and Reference Validation

**Autocomplete Behavior**:
- The `/api/autocomplete` endpoint provides dropdown options for requirement references (Primary Actor, Outcome, etc.)
- During editing, autocomplete shows requirements from all visible workflow states: Active, Proposed, and Review
- Each option displays the workflow state (e.g., "HR Manager (Active)", "Screening Process (Proposed)") to help users make informed choices
- Requirements in Rejected, Removed and Parsed states are excluded from autocomplete options

**Reference Validation**:
- While requirements can reference others in any visible workflow state during editing
- All referenced requirements must be Active before the referencing requirement can be approved
- Approval attempts with non-Active references will fail with descriptive error messages
- Example error: "Cannot approve requirement because referenced requirement 'HR Manager' (primaryActor) is in Proposed state instead of Active. All referenced requirements must be Active before this requirement can be approved."

This design enables flexible editing while enforcing data integrity through topological ordering validation.

## Troubleshooting

Most issues can be resolved by restarting the dev container. This can be done by closinng and reopening VSCode. Don't do this too quickly. When VSCode is closed, the Docker containers take some time to stop.

If you are still having issues, try deleting the containers and images and restarting the dev container.

If you run into issues related to npm install hanging ([Known bug](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4028)). You can try running `npm install` on each dependency individually. For example: `npm install @mikro-orm/core`, `npm install nuxt`, etc. This is a worst case scenario and seems to surface intermittently. The bug is potentially related to IPV6.
